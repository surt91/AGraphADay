# TODO

    * clustering algorithms to color the nodes
    * do something sensible with bipartite graphs (special layouts)
    * SQLAlchemy/SQLite db to store data (instead of textfiles)
    * generate social network on request (graph of followers on twitter)

    * The script needs to be consolidated to have a single entry point with command line parsing.
